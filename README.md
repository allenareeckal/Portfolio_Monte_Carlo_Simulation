# Modern Portfolio Theory
## Monte Carlo Simulation

### Solution of simulation execution is presented below:

1. Portfolio Inflation Adjusted Values from Simulation
2. Number of simulations = 10,000
3. Each simulation projected over 20 years
4. Initial investment = $100,000
5. Inflation adjusted at the rate of 3.5% each year

| Portfolio Type        | Median 20th Year | 10% Best Case | 10% Worst Case |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| A - Aggressive        | $242,705.39      | $553,313.99   | $101,606.52    |
| I - Very Conservative | $157,740.04      | $220,910.01   | $111,531.90    |
